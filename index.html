<h1>Hi! I'm Tuchau and I am a senior at <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/">Fordham</a>.</h1>

<h2>I absolutely despise cooking.</h2>

<!-- Use b or strong tags for bold -->
 <!-- Use i or em tags for italics -->

<p>The oil splatters when trying to sustain myself is terrifying to be honest.</p>
<p>But I <i><b>LOVE</b></i> to bake! I've made strawberry shortcakes, crepe cakes, and cheesecakes.</p>

<p>Maybe not ones as fancy as these photos... but I can make a decent pastry.</p>

<h3>I have a Shiba Inu named Lucky!</h3>

<h4>He's a little smaller than traditional Shibas because he's actually a Kishu!</h4>

<h5>He's a sassy boy who loves the snow.</h5>

<h6>As a theatre nerd, I hope ot one day open a Broadway themed study cafe.</h6>
