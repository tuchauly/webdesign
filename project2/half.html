                <h1>OMG Such a MODEL!!</h1>

            <h3>Initially a <i>quiet and timid</i> boy, Lucky (aka <b>Sir Luck</b>) took some time to adapt to city life. But as he explored the neighborhood through his walks, he became excited for his new home! Now, at 6 months old, Lucky has become a <u>model</u>. Just look at him ðŸ¤­ Everyone has photos of him on thier phones and there is <i><b>barely</b></i> any storage left for other apps. His little self always judged whoever took his photo, but nevertheless, he posed and was patient, even if he was in the middle of eating a flower petal.</h3>
