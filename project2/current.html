                        <h3>Now a <u><b>full-fledged</b></u> adult doggie, Lucky has become a menace and embraced his menace nature. <br> <br> Throughout the day, we find him snoozing on his <u>(expensive)</u> couches we bought him when he was younger. Most days are very tiring for him. Not only does he protect his humans from the mailman, but he goes on hour-long adventures, chase squirels and mark his territory. He also fully embraced his only-child status <i><b>(he gets upset if we mention getting him a brother)</b></i> thorugh a plethora of toys, a slection of treats, and a personal heater. <br> <br> Regardless, <b><u><i>we all love Sir Luck!</i></u></b></h3>
