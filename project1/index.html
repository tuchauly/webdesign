                <h3><i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Newbery Medal-winning author Neil Gaiman's modern classic, <i>Coraline</i></h3>
                <p>When Coraline steps through a door to find another house strangely similar to her own (only better), things seem marvelous. <br>

                    But there's another mother there, and another father, and they want her to stay and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go. <br>
                    
                    Coraline will have to fight with all her wits and courage if she is to save herself and return to her ordinary life.</p>

                <h4>Sometimes, when he was smaller, people used to tell Neil Gaiman not to make things up. He never listened. Now he's written more than twenty-five books and has been given dozens of awards, many of them been given dozens of awards, many of them astonishingly ugly. He’s written television drama and for movies, and for comics. He’s even written “non-fiction”, which he learned is only marginally less made-up than the fiction. Sometimes he thinks about finding some of those people who warned him of all the awful things that would happen if he kept making things up, and finding out if it’s happened yet, or is still going to happen, and whether he should buy a tin hat and thick boots for protection. In the meantime, he grows pumpkins and keeps on making things up.</h4>
